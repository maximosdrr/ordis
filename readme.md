## Getting Started

The first step to start the project is to go to the Neuroptics / src directory and create a file called "connection-config.h", inside it you will need to have a code similar to this one replacing the values with your personal settings

```c++
const char *SSID = "YOUR SSID"; //wifi name
const char *PASSWORD = "YOUR WIFI PASSWORD"; //wifi password
const char *MQTT_SERVER = "BROKER SERVER IP LIKE 10.0.0.000"; //broker server
const int MQTT_PORT = MQTT_PORT; //broker port

```
