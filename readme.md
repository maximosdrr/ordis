# Ordis

An open source project that aims to create a controller for arduino extensions using the MQTT protocol, in addition we also created a broker server for mqtt where a socket.io interface is used for easy communication with devices of any type

## Getting Started

The first step to start the project is to go to the "Neuroptics/src" directory and create a file called "connection-config.h", inside it you will need to have a code similar to this one replacing the values with your personal settings

```c++
const char *SSID = "YOUR SSID"; //wifi name
const char *PASSWORD = "YOUR WIFI PASSWORD"; //wifi password
const char *MQTT_SERVER = "BROKER SERVER IP "; //broker server example: 10.0.0.000
const int MQTT_PORT = 3000; //broker port
```

Now we need to configure the .env file in the system part of ordis, first go to the "Systems" folder and inside it create a file called .env, inside it you should have a configuration similar to this one

```javascript
MQTT_PORT=YOUR_MQTT_PORT //example: 3000
EXPRESS_PORT=YOUR_EXPRESS_PORT //example: 3001
MQTT_HOST="YOUR_MQTT_HOST"  //example: "mqtt://10.0.0.107"
BROKER_HOST="YOUR_BROKER_HOST" //example "10.0.0.107"
```


now to finish the process we just need to give an npm install or yarn to install the node_modules and the systems will be ready to run

```
npm install
```
npm run dev start the server

```
npm run dev
```

### Prerequisites

To develop neuroptics you will need to use the "platformio" iot platform, for the server you will need nodejs to be installed on your machine
